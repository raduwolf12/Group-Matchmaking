## Requirements

- Node.js and Angular CLI
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- PostgreSQL database

## Installation

1. Install the required software as mentioned in the Requirements section.

2. Frontend (Angular):
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the "frontend" directory.
   - Run the following command to install the dependencies:

     npm install

   - Once the dependencies are installed, build the Angular application using the following command:

     ng build --configuration production

3. Backend (Java):
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the "backend" directory.
   - Compile the Java source code and package it into a JAR file using the following commands:

     mvnw clean package -DskipTests

     Replace "your-application.jar" with the desired name for your JAR file.

4. Database (PostgreSQL):
   - Ensure that you have a PostgreSQL database installed and running.
   - Create a new database and note down the connection details (hostname, port, database name, username, password).

5. Configuration:
   - In the "backend" directory, locate the "application.properties" file.
   - Open the file in a text editor and update the PostgreSQL connection details:

     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://hostname:port/database
     spring.datasource.username=username
     spring.datasource.password=password


## Usage

1. Run the application:
   - Open a command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the main folder (the one containing "frontend" and "backend" directories).
   - Run the following command to start the frontend and backend servers:

     start cmd /k "cd frontend && http-server ./dist -p 4200"
     start cmd /k "cd backend/target && java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"


2. Access the application:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Enter the following URL: http://localhost:4200
   - You should now see the Angular frontend of the application.
